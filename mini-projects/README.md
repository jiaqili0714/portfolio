# Mini-Project Assignments

> At least 2 mini-projects, along with one substantive revision, should be completed by their respective due dates.

## About

The course mini-projects will provide you with opportunities to practice ethnographic research and cultural analysis. Mini-projects are the predominant way that you will practice the Data Ethnography Methods learning dimension in this course. 

## Learning Objectives

* Identify, implement, and critique data ethnography research methods
* Develop observational habits in data-saturated environments
* Develop skill in analyzing social forces and systems
* Plan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback

## Instructions

For your first mini-project assignment, you should select one of the following options to complete. For your second mini-project assignment, you should select a **separate** option to complete. Detailed instructions for each mini-project are listed on the READMEs of each sub-directory in this directory. 

### Option 1: [Interview a data professional](interview)
### Option 2: [Cultural analysis of a data infrastructure](infrastructural-analysis)
### Option 3: [Discourse Analysis](discourse-analysis)
### Option 4: [Participant Observation](participant-observation)

Each of these assignments involves collecting some ethnographic data, interpreting the data, determining a central point that the data supports, and then writing it up in a memo that draws from your data to support that point. This means that mini-project write-ups will be more polished than your fieldnotes (i.e. you don't need to identify and support a central point or argument in your fieldnotes).

### Revision

After receiving feedback from me on both submissions, you will have an opportunity to revise one of your submissions. This assignment has three steps:

1. Read [this document](https://lsa.umich.edu/content/dam/sweetland-assets/sweetland-documents/teachingresources/SequencingandScaffoldingAssignments/Supplement3_HowtoWriteaRevisionPlan.pdf) on creating a revision plan. 
2. Open and follow the instructions in `revision-plan.Rmd`.
3. Revise your submission in the same Markdown document you had previously been working in based on what you outlined in your revision plan. Push your changes to GitHub. 

> Remember that grammar, spelling, and punctuation concerns should not be included in a revision plan. Those concerns are addressed in a proofreading stage, not a revising stage.

#### Criteria for Completion

* Student submits a revision plan with descriptions of at least three pieces of feedback they plan to address in their revision and an indication of how they will address it.
* Student submits a revised version of one of their MPs.
