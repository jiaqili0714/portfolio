# Mini-Project Assignments

> At least 2 mini-projects, along with one substantive revision, should be completed by their respective due dates.

## About

The course mini-projects will provide you with opportunities to practice ethnographic research and cultural analysis. Mini-projects are the predominant way that you will practice the Data Ethnography Methods learning dimension in this course. 

## Learning Objectives

* Identify, implement, and critique data ethnography research methods
* Develop observational habits in data-saturated environments
* Develop skill in analyzing social forces and systems
* Plan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback

## Instructions

For your first mini-project assignment, you should select one of the following options to complete. For your second mini-project assignment, you should select a **separate** option to complete. Detailed instructions for each mini-project are listed on the READMEs of each sub-directory in this directory. 

### Option 1: [Interview a data professional](interview)
### Option 2: [Cultural analysis of a data infrastructure](infrastructural-analysis)
### Option 3: [Discourse Analysis](discourse-analysis)
### Option 4: [Participant Observation](participant-observation)

Each of these assignments involves collecting some ethnographic data, interpreting the data, determining a central point that the data supports, and then writing it up in a memo that draws from your data to support that point. This means that mini-project write-ups will be more polished than your fieldnotes (i.e. you don't need to identify and support a central point or argument in your fieldnotes).

### Revision

After receiving feedback from me on both submissions, you will have an opportunity to revise one of your submissions. You will revise this submission in the same Markdown document you had previously been working in, and you will push your changes to this GitHub repo. In additional 

First, you should read the attached document on how to create a revision plan. Then you should begin writing a revision plan, following the template in the Markdown document in this directory. Finally, revise your MP following your revision plan. Remember that grammar, spelling, and punctuation concerns should not be included in a revision plan. Those concerns are addressed in a proofreading stage, not a revising stage.

#### Criteria for Completion

* Student submits a revision plan with descriptions of at least three pieces of feedback they plan to address in their revision and an indication of how they will address it.
* Student submits a revised version of one of their MPs.
