You might address questions like: How would you characterize your standpoint in relation to the research? In what ways did your background and situated knowledge inflect how you approached your research and what you took away from it? In what moments were there communication break-downs with your informants and why? What feelings came up for you during research? What ethical considerations were you grappling with as you engaged the research?

### Option 3: [Fieldnote Synthesis Memo]
